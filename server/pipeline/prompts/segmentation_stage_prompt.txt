Hi!  Could you parse some text and identify the following:
- The start and end of each distinct scene
- The name of the scene (scene.name) 
- The body of each scene (scene.body)
- The starting character index of the scene (scene.startIndex)
- The ending character of the scene (scene.endIndex)
- The start index of the first scene (top level object)
- The end index of the last scene (top level object)

Please use JSON as the output format to aggregate a collection of scene(s).  Here is a sample of the schema you should use:

{
  "startIndex": 157,
  "endIndex": 24350,

  "scenes": [
    {  
        "name": "The Tortoise and the Hare",
        "body": "<story goes here>,
        "startIndex": 157,
        "endIndex": 835
    },
    {  
        "name": "The Fox and the Scorpion",
        "body": "<story goes here>,
        "startIndex": 835,
        "endIndex": 1876
    }
  ]
}

Below is the text to parse:

{{story_data}}
