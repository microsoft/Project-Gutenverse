Hi!  Could you parse some text and identify the following:
- The start and end of each distinct scene.  A scene has a clear beginning and end, usually marked by a change of location, time, or perspective
- The name of the scene (scene.name) 
- The body of each scene (scene.body)
- The starting character index of the scene (scene.start_index)
- The ending character of the scene (scene.end_index)
- The start index of the first scene (top level object)
- The end index of the last scene (top level object)

Please use JSON as the output format to aggregate a collection of scene(s).  Here is a sample of the schema you should use:

{
  "start_index": 157,
  "end_index": 24350,

  "scenes": [
    {  
        "name": "The Tortoise and the Hare",
        "body": "<story goes here>,
        "start_index": 157,
        "end_index": 835
    },
    {  
        "name": "The Fox and the Scorpion",
        "body": "<story goes here>,
        "start_index": 835,
        "end_index": 1876
    }
  ]
}

Though please avoid using any line breaks in the JSON formatting.

Below is the text to parse:
