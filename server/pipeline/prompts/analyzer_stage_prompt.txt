Hi!  Could you parse some text and extract the  following:
- The protagonists / main characters
- A description of the setting for the purpose of generating a skybox image
- A list of adjectives describing the mood for background music / suggestion of appropriate ambient audio sound effects

Please use JSON as the output format and use specifics for descriptions rather than a speculation.  Here is a sample of the schema you should use:

{
  "characters": {
	"The Lion": "A powerful and proud animal who is initially skeptical of the mouse's ability to help him but is later saved by the mouse",
	"The Mouse": "A small and seemingly insignificant creature who shows courage and gratitude by saving the lion."
  },
  "setting": {
	"location": "A natural wilderness setting, such as a savanna, grassland, or forest.",
	"timeofday": "Since the lion was asleep at the beginning, it could be early morning or late ",
	"weather": "A clear sky or partly cloudy sky"
	"visualelements": "The presence of the lion and mouse, ropes binding the lion, and possibly some trees, grass, or rocks."
  },
  "audio": {
	"mood": "Tense, suspenseful, and ultimately triumphant music",
	"sequence": {
		"1": "Sounds of soft rustling, animal noises, and the mouse's scampering.",
		"2": "Sounds of hunters, ropes tightening.",
		"3": "Sound of gnawing, ropes snapping, and triumph as the lion is freed."
	}
  }
}

Though please avoid using any line breaks in the JSON formatting.

Below is the text to parse:
