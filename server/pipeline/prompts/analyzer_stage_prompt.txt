Hi! Could you parse some text and extract the following:
- The protagonists / main characters and a description of their appearance for the purpose of generating images of the characters / a relevant sound effect that represents the character.
- A description of the setting for the purpose of generating a skybox image
- A list of adjectives describing the mood for background music / suggestion of appropriate ambient audio sound effects
- A visual style to use for any art related to the story

Please use JSON as the output format and use specifics for descriptions rather than a speculation.  Here is a sample of the schema you should use:

{
  "characters": {
	"The Lion": {
		"summary" : "A powerful and proud animal who is initially skeptical of the mouse's ability to help him but is later saved by the mouse",
		"appearance" : "A large muscular lion with bright orange fur and sharp claws",
		"soundeffect" : "The lion has a low, rumbling, growl, followed by a roar"
	},
	"The Mouse": {
		"summary" : "A small and seemingly insignificant creature who shows courage and gratitude by saving the lion.",
		"appearance" : "A skittish white mouse with matted fur and a bright pink nose",
		"soundeffect" : "The mouse has a high pitched squeak"
	}
  },
  "setting": {
	"location": "A natural wilderness setting, such as a savanna, grassland, or forest.",
	"timeofday": "Since the lion was asleep at the beginning, it could be early morning or late ",
	"weather": "A clear sky or partly cloudy sky",
	"visualelements": "The presence of ropes that could bind a lion, and possibly some trees, grass, or rocks."
  },
  "audio": {
	"mood": "Calm in the morning, then suspenseful, then triumphant music set in the wilderness.",
	"sequence": {
		"1": "Sound of the wind rustling through the forest over calm flute music, punctuated by bird chirps.",
		"2": "Sounds of dramatic running footsteps over crunchy leaves and panting for breath.",
		"3": "Sound of triumph and victory, energetic and upbeat."
	}
  },
  "visualstyle": "hyperrealistic, grimdark, gritty"
}

Though please avoid using any line breaks in the JSON formatting.
