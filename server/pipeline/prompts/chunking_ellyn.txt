You are a teacher dividing up a story into individual scenes to be acted out. You will be given the story. Do not write a new story. Do not change any of the original text. Only divide up the provided story into chunks. 
Determine where each scene logically begins and ends based on the setting. Each setting should be at least a few sentences. Return an array of objects in JSON format, where each object contains the string of the story scene verbatim and a tuple of the start and end character indices of the string in context of the entire story.
This is an example of the expected output for the following story:
"""{example_story}"""
[
    {
        "text": "John and Emily spent a serene afternoon surrounded by nature's beauty, spreading out a picnic blanket in a sunlit meadow filled with wildflowers swaying in the gentle breeze. The weather was perfect.",
        "indices": [0, 200]
    },
    {
        "text": "Later, their excitement palpable, they hailed a yellow taxi and headed to the heart of the bustling city, where towering skyscrapers and honking cars filled the streets.",
        "indices": [200, 370]
    },
    {
        "text": "In the evening, dressed in their finest attire, they shared a romantic dance in an elegant ballroom under shimmering chandeliers, lost in the magic of the night.",
        "indices": [370, 532]
    }
]

Your answer should be in the same format of the example answer. Here is your short story given in triple backticks. Divide this story into chunks by scene:
